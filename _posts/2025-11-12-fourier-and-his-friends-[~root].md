This post is intended to be the first in a series of notes covering a concise summary and overview of linear systems and Fourier theory.
The goal here is at first to just have a place to return to for myself when I want to review some of these topics.
The notes will be split into 4 parts:
- [basics of systems (also called operators)](fourier-and-his-friends-p1)
- [Fourier series and transform for continuous signals](fourier-and-his-friends-p2)
- Fourier series and transform for discrete signals
- The Laplace transform
