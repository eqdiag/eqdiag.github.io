Last weekend I started playing through the new remastered version of [submachine](https://mateuszskutnik.itch.io/submachine-legacy).
I typically really like these kinds of eery atmospheric puzzle games.

The bells and cubes puzzle from *ch1: basement* is pretty straightforward, but it seemed like a more general version could be
interesting.

## Some Questions
- What if we change the number of blocks and bells?
- What happens if we change the blocks that the bells affect?
- When can we always guarantee there is some sequence of bells that lifts all the blocks?
- For a given set of bells, what's the fewest number of rings to lift all the blocks?
