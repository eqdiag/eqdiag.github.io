My goal with this site is to do a couple of different things:

First, I want to have a relatively up to date place to post recent projects I've been working on.
I have a lot of miscellaneous stuff I've written and worked on over the years and I'd like to have a central 
place to show people that stuff.

Second, I want to create educational resources for others. For some technical topics, I've been unable to find
online resources that dig into enough detail for me to feel like I understand them.
So, I'll try and create those resources here.

I'd also like to treat this as a personal blog where I post about things happening in my life.
This will include some of my hobbies :).

We'll see how often I end up posting :p.
