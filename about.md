Hey there, I'm Daniel.

I recently finished a PhD in theoretical computer science at Brown University.
My [research](writing) was at the intersection of game theory and distributed computing.

I've also always had a passion for physics, computer graphics, and computer systems.
You can find some programs I've written [here](projects).
